        <h5>Mixolo wants to partner with you:</h5>
        <p>We aim to build mutually-benefically partnerships with our solo-friendly event hosts and venues ready to provide
        unique experiences that accomodate groups of solos who may be connecting for the first time.
        </p>
        <h5>Our philosophy of inclusion:</h5>
        <p>Per our value statements we encourage inclusive practices that result in meaningful connections and respectful engagement
          among our members and hosts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some events may naturally attract specific members/patrons, but no Mixolo event should designate physical, gender, ethnic, racial, religios, sexual orientation or politicatal attributes as pre-cursor to participation.
        </p>
        <p>Age may only be addressed in context with our 18 and over membership requirement and in accordance with
          any legal age restrictions (e.g. 21 and over) on participation.
        </p>
        <p>Our philosophy of inclusion is essential to a successful Mixolo experience.</p>

        <h5>Your Mixolo event or experience.</h5>
        <p>We expect that our event hosts will want to create and promote memorable experiences that "fill their seats" AND result in loyal relationships with our members.</p>
        <p>We are looking to distrupt the practice of customer in and customer out, Our members to want to opt in 
        solo and find fulfillment in the pursuit of their passions, and we want you to find creative ways to engage with them
        and make that happen. They will return to you, hopefully with Mixolo, but also, on
        </p>
        <p>At this time, we are limiting our events to those organized and originating in the the US.Foreign travel that originates in the US is permitted.</p>
        <p>Any person or business can host an event provided they are legally operating entity.Sole propritorships may host an event
        if they are registered with their home state and/or have a verfiable web footprint (web/mobile site or app,social media, online reviews).
