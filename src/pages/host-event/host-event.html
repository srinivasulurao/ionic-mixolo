Let Mixolo help. We want to disrupt the stigma of going out alone and increase your
customer base and patronage.</div><br>

Our  solos are looking for ways to connect and engage with other
like-minded people when they do the things they love to do. We are not a "ticket" reseller. We are curators of experiences
that are designed to accomodate groups of solos.
