<h1>Give your event a title</h1>
  <ion-input [(ngModel)]="event_title"></ion-input>
  <p>
    Let's begin here. As you design your event, you see how it will appear to your guests. First, give your
    event a title that pops. Be descriptive enough to convey what your event is about, but keep it brief enough to catch
    your guests attention. Have fun with it.
